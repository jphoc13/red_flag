This is best run on Pycharm with Python

So install Pycharm CE and Python 3.8 or higher.

This is just a basic set up for reading from a .sql file locally, initializing a sqllite db
and then having the data transferred from the .sql file into the sql lite db.

However, there is an issue with the data in the .sql file and so parsing it is causing errors.

To run this locally take the coverageF.sql file and paste it into the red_flag directory.
But don't try to commit this .sql file because it is too large for a git repo.

To install dependencies, run this in terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
